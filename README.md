# TurbidityApp

TurbidityApp visulizes water quality data from samples collected at 8 beaches in the Greater Los Angeles area. The app is in sync with a googlesheet that's being maintained by the JPL Remote Sensing team from the Envrionmental Science Practicum at UCLA. 

The access token to the spreadsheet is not included in this Git Repository. If you would like to have the access to the raw data, please email to caoalbert@g.ucla.edu.
